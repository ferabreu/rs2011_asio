# Additional technical details about RS2011-ASIO

## RS_ASIO.ini configuration

The default `dist/RS_ASIO.ini` file requires the following additional configuration for Rocksmith 2011:

```ini
[Config]
EnableWasapiInputs=1   ; required — enables WASAPI capture device enumeration

[Asio.Output]
Driver=wineasio-rsasio

[Asio.Input.0]
Driver=wineasio-rsasio
WasapiDevice=Rocksmith  ; matches the Real Tone Cable's friendly name on Wine/Proton
```

### WasapiDevice matching

The `WasapiDevice=` value is matched **case-insensitively** against both:
- The full WASAPI device ID string (e.g. `{0.0.1.00000000}.{21D5646C-D708-4E90-A57A-E1956015D4F3}`)
- The device's friendly name (e.g. `Rocksmith Guitar Adapter Mono`)

The value `Rocksmith` matches all known Real Tone Cable variants on Wine/Proton by friendly name.

If this does not match on your system, run the game once, open `RS_ASIO.log`, and look for lines like:

```
{0.0.1.00000000}.{21D5646C-...} friendly name: "Rocksmith Guitar Adapter Mono"
```

Use any substring of the friendly name, or a fragment of the GUID, as the `WasapiDevice=` value.

## Rocksmith.ini

RS2011's `Rocksmith.ini` (in the game folder) must have:

```ini
[Audio]
ExclusiveMode=1
```

## Troubleshooting

**Game asks to connect the Real Tone Cable at the tuner screen**

The WASAPI redirect did not activate. Check `RS_ASIO.log` for a line containing:
```
redirecting IAudioClient to ASIO input
```

The full log line includes the device ID and function name, e.g.:
```
{0.0.1.00000000}.{21D5646C-...} Activate - redirecting IAudioClient to ASIO input
```

If this line is absent, the `WasapiDevice=` value did not match any enumerated capture device. See the [WasapiDevice matching](#wasapidevice-matching) section above.

**No audio output**

Verify WineASIO is installed and the `Driver=wineasio-rsasio` name matches what appears in the `RS_ASIO.log` under `AsioHelpers::FindDrivers`.

**Crackling or dropouts**

If you experience dropouts, adjust your PipeWire quantum and buffer settings. The typical setup uses 256 frames at 48kHz (5ms latency), set via `PIPEWIRE_LATENCY="256/48000"` — but these are recommendations, not hard constraints. You may need to increase buffer size if dropouts persist.

## How RS2011 audio differs from RS2014

Understanding these differences explains why extra configuration is needed.

### Output

Both games use WASAPI exclusive mode for audio output. RS ASIO intercepts the WASAPI device enumeration and injects fake WASAPI devices backed by ASIO. This mechanism works identically for both games — no special configuration is needed for output.

### Guitar input

This is where RS2011 and RS2014 diverge fundamentally.

**RS2014** uses WASAPI exclusive mode for the Real Tone Cable but does so through normal COM device enumeration, which RS ASIO already intercepts and redirects to ASIO.

**RS2011** uses WASAPI exclusive mode in **polling mode** — it does not request event-driven callbacks (`AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_EVENTCALLBACK`), instead calling `GetCurrentPadding` in a loop to detect when new audio data is available. Under Wine/Proton, this combination causes RS ASIO to incorrectly warn that the game is not using WASAPI. This warning is suppressed for RS2011.

More importantly, RS2011 **does not select its guitar input through normal WASAPI device enumeration**. Instead, it identifies the Real Tone Cable by its specific WASAPI device path (a `{flow}.{endpoint-GUID}` string assigned by Wine/Proton), opens it directly in exclusive mode, and begins polling. Wine/Proton's WASAPI implementation rejects all audio formats offered by the game for the Real Tone Cable in exclusive mode — making the cable unusable without RS ASIO.

### The RS ASIO solution for RS2011

RS ASIO intercepts `IMMDevice::Activate` for IAudioClient. When the game activates the Real Tone Cable's WASAPI device, RS ASIO detects the match (via `WasapiDevice=` in the INI) and returns an ASIO-backed `RSAsioAudioClient` instead of Wine's broken implementation. The game receives audio from the configured ASIO input channel transparently.

Audio format negotiation is also handled: RS2011 offers float32 mono as its preferred format, which is compatible with WineASIO's native `ASIOSTFloat32LSB` type — no conversion needed.

The ASIO host is shared between output (already running for music playback) and input, using the same buffer size and sample rate. Only sample rate and buffer size are compared when the second client joins the shared host — format tag differences between output (PCM16) and input (float32 extensible) are intentionally ignored.
